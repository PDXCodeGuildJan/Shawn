steps to add a fairly static app to a django project:

1)activate a venv:

$ source ./randomnamedvirtualenv/bin/activate


2)Starting the server. Navigate to the django project directory that contains manage.py:

$ python3 manage.py runserver


3)Start a second terminal window with an activated venv (I like to do this just in case i need it superstitious reasons)

4)For Apple people make sure "your elephants on" wtf that means :)

5)
